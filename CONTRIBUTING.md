# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request.

## Development setup

See the [README](README.md) for full setup. You need `npm install` in the repo root and `npm install` in `ui/`.

## Quality checks

Run `npm run check` before submitting a PR. It runs lint, typecheck, and tests.

## Code style

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Do not use ESLint or Prettier.

## Large changes

Open an issue first for large changes so we can discuss the approach before you invest time.
